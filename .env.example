# Since .env is gitignored, you can use .env.example to build a new `.env` file when you clone the repo.
# Keep this file up-to-date when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any secrets in it.
# If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named `.env` and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional env variables, the schema in /env/schema.mjs should be updated accordingly

# NOTE: For secrets eg; auth tokens, you can find them in the GitHub repository secrets section.
# To use them in development, create a file just named `.env` and then add the variables below 
# to it, and add the values from the repo secrets.
